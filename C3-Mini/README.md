# D1- / C3-Mini Projects with Environmental Shields (CLOUDFREE!)
## DS18B20
This repository contains a collection of D1- / C3-Mini sketches that utilize the DS18B20 sensor, one of the environmental sensors, used for temperature measurements.

## Getting Started
To get started with this sensor, you need a D1- / C3-Mini board and optionally a triple adapter. The code for each microcontroller is included in this repository, and you can upload it to your D1- / C3-Mini board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible programming environment.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP8266 D1-Mini / ESP32 C3-Mini 
- Environmental shield/sensor
- Optional:
  - 0.66 OLED Display
  - Dual- or Triple-Adapter

## Software Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for programming the ESP8266 D1-mini
- [ESP8266 library for Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
- [0.66 OLED SHIELD library](https://github.com/mcauser/Adafruit_SSD1306/tree/esp8266-64x48)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Digital-Weather-Station.git`
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the ESP8266 D1-mini.
3. Connect the environmental shield to the ESP8266 D1-mini.
4. Power the ESP8266 D1-mini using a USB cable.
